# Project2
I'll be the first to admit that this project was very confusing to me. I tried to follow the instructions best i could, i started by creating a repository named "Project 2". I then created a README file as a place where i could explain myself. After that i was intsructed to create a very simple bash script which was named "hello world". After that i followed the rest of the directions which wanted me to create a backup script. I was wrote the code given from the original website and kept updating it like it asked, but im having trouble knowing if it works. Im able to see it in "pull requests" on github and its labeled as a backuo but im not sure if it works properly as a backup script.
